**💡 Explanation of Business Problem**
The pizza store was generating large volumes of sales data but lacked clear insights into which products drive the most revenue, customer purchase behavior, and peak demand periods. Without structured analysis, it was difficult for management to make data-driven decisions on promotions, inventory, and menu optimization.
